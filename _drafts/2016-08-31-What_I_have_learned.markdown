title: What I've Got from Summer Job 2016

{% include base.html %}

1. A nice experience, of learning and working.

  This is literally first time in my life I worked as full-time, in my majority related fields. I remembered the moment I received email from Andrea that informs me I'm hired, I was in great happiness. The feeling of being recognized, being considered as good, is just SO FUCKING NICE!!!

  By the very beginning of my job here, nothing did I know about AngularJS and Javascript, which means I have to work quite hard on conquering them to meet the requirement of this job, and I did. Thanks Yves, for this recommendation about CodeSchool, and the discount coupon.On CodeSchool I spent 9 euros on getting a one month membership, and a one whole month on learning and practicing. Though I was very Junior by the start of contract, what I've learned helped me a lot
